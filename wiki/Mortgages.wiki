#summary Mortgages and things to watch out for

= Introduction =

It might still be a while before I need to do anything about getting a mortgage but over time I have read things which will come in handy when I eventually try and get one.  This document outlines things I thought necessary to remember.

== Considerations ==

  * Additional fees
   # Ask about additional fees when getting a mortgage.  Some have a closing payment fee for example.
  * Overpayments
   # Inquire about how much I can overpay, some restrict overpayments to 10%.
   # Ask if I can take a payment break with any money that has been overpaid for a particular year.
   # Make sure I am not penalised for being more thrifty!
   # When overpaying on fixed deals, make sure there is no penalty for overpaying so much that you finish the mortgage before the fixed term ends.
   # Find out when interest is calculated, for fixed/flexible mortgages, you need to get one which calculates it daily so that it has an immediate impact.
