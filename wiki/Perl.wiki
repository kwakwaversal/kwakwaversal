= Wiki =

For an upcoming project, I have decided to include a messaging system.  The messaging system will typically accept google wiki style formatting, compile it, then store it in the database.

I have decided to use `Text::GooglewikiFormat` to do the formatting as I believe it will be the easiest for people to pick up.
