#summary Stuff about houses that I've picked up

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Introduction =

Exactly what I put in the summary.  This is a collection of snippets of information that might come in handy when looking for, or building onto a new house.

= Buying =

Property

  * When buying a house, look out for papered ceilings as it could be hiding a multitude of sins.
  * Tiled rooves need to be replaced every 50 years or so.  Look for fractures in the tiles, and plant life growing as tell tale signs.
  * Always take into account the direction of the sun in the afternoon.  South-west facing gardens get more sun because in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun is below the zenith during its observed travel from east to west and hence if you are facing south, the sun is shining directly on you during the day. If you are facing North, the sun is shining on your back and in the case of a garden, the shadow of the house blocks the sun most of the time.
  * Don't ever trust anything said by the vendor or estate agent, they are trying to sell. If you have any queries get the answers in writing. ^1^
  * Always get a full survey. ^1^
  * Assume the worst, especially when it comes to boilers and electrics. ^1^
  * Never buy a property that has had major damp or dry rot problems. ^1^
  * There's no harm in making an offer lower than the asking price. If the builders aren't willing to drop then try and get some freebies thrown in like carpets and vinyl, turf for the garden, stamp duty paid, etc. ^1^
  * Hassle your solicitor as frequently as needed, you're paying them so you have every right to ask them as many questions as needed, and if you haven't heard anything for a while then ring them and ask for updates. ^1^
  * Drive round the area at different times of day (we tried midnight at weekends etc). By doing this we managed to discount loads of houses that looked go inside but the area wasn't too good in the evening; saved the time on viewings. ^1^
  * Get a copy of the title plan and deeds from the land registry before you put an offer in. My Brother in Law didn't and only found out much later that the garden was not included in the deeds. Because he hadn't spent a few pounds getting it online, it cost him several hundred in solicitors fees etc. Ouch. ^1^
  * Solicitors are expensive, full stop. Having said that, the other side will pay your legal fees if you tell them you're not buying if they dont! This should also stop them from messing about later if they have to pay two lots of fees. ^1^
  * Test everything, every light switch, every plug, the cooker, the taps, the toilet. It's annoying when you find out afterwards what doesnt work. ^1^
  * Don't be afraid to throw your weight about making demands. You're spending an absolute shedload of money and it'll take you years to pay it off. Be cheeky, if you don't ask, you won't get. ^1^
  * Write into any contract that the seller must leave the house within X days, regardless of if they have a property to move into or not. -Ken Crabtree
  * When the survey talks about the "higher maintenance costs associated with a property of this type and age", find out what that means in practice and with real money. ^1^
  * Check the size of the garden, especially if you are buying a house that could be sold on to a family. Postage stamp-sized gardens will take longer to sell. ^1^
  * Next time I buy a place, (last 2 have had awful neighbours one side), I will draw up a legally binding questionnaire for the sellers regarding the neighbours. If they don't want to complete it then you know why. ^1^

Materials

  * Always get 3 quotes for the same job. ^1^

= Selling =

  * If you're looking to up the value of your property with a loft conversion.  Check the local properties to see if the extra room will take the number of rooms in the house, to a level where there is a shortage in the area.  Else it's not worth it.
  * If you have a great garden, think about selling in the spring or summer, so what is a casual glance in the colder months, becomes a main selling point in the warmer months.
  * Don't have a coloured bathroom suite.
  * Use expensive fittings to get the best out of a bathroom sale.

= House types =

Period houses
  * When taking wall paper off period houses, the plaster will most likely come off.  Added expenses.
  * Look under the carpets and check the finish/state of the floors.

= Sections =

Extensions
  * When building extensions, always go for pitched roofs, as flat ones will always give you trouble.

Misc
  * If you knock through walls to join two rooms, think about families, and how they would prefer to have two separate spaces.  One for the kids, and one for themselves.

= Misc =

  * Textured ceilings (artexed) where there is limited light draws the light in, and gives nothing out.  Think about smoothing them off.
  * Depending on the type of house (victorian, older houses), think about going for wooden framed double glazing rather than PVC.  If they retain the original sash windows, do not replace them (it'll cost a fortune), and secondary glaze, or get units to fit the existing windows.
  * Every main room should have a centrepiece, without it, there is no focal point.
  * A downstairs toilet needs to be near the main soil pipe.  Don't even think about putting one on the other side of the house!
  * Know when enough is enough, don't over-develop your property as it could damage it in the long run.

= References =

When buying your first property, some of the tips above were taken from the moneysavingexpert forum.  Below are links to references I've used to compile the list above.
