Places to go:
  * The drive over Tiede is absolutely stunning (up and over via Vilaflor and the long road back down via Tamaimo through the lava fields & forest are my favourite drives of anywhere.)
  * Visit the Monkey Park it is AMAZING and only 10euros per adult.
  * I was also going to recommend a trip to Masca (a precariously perched mountain village) but due to the rather steep/narrow road and as a first-time driver using the right-hand side of the road, maybe save that for another time!
