#summary Poems that I've memorised, and how long they've taken me.


= Introduction =

This is a collection of poems that I've memorised, and roughly how long they've taken me.

I intend to try and remember these forever, but this will take a while and lots of recall. I hope to remember to tag the relevant information alongside the poems, so I can gauge how long it takes for a poem to go from short term, to long term memory.

Shel Silverstein (1930-1999)
