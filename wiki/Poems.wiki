#summary Poems that I've memorised, and how long they've taken me.


= Introduction =

This is a collection of poems that I've memorised, and roughly how long they've taken me.

The time next to the poems is how long it's taken me to do a perfect recall of the poem at least twice.

I intend to try and remember these forever, but this will take a while and lots of recall. I am trying different techniques to help me test recall of these poems. Currently using two Android apps `AnkiDroid`, and `RememberMe`.
