#summary Linux related stuff

= Introduction =

This is some linux related stuff I have made a place for.  I intend to break this up at some point but I don't have enough content.

== GUI Notification ==

install libnotify-bin and you get a program called 'notify-send'.  

=== Perl modules ===

  * Gtk2::Notify
  * Desktop::Notify

== Installing oracle libraries on Debian ==

To install the oracle client on debian, you must download some .rpms from the [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/linuxsoft.html Oracle website].  The job I did was on oracle server 8i, so I found out the compatible version I needed was 10.2.0.4.

Download:

  * Basic lite RPM
  * Sqlplus RPM
  * Devel

Once they are downloaded, install and use 'alien' from the debian repository and run

 alien *.rpm

By default this will create .deb packages for each rpm.  It's also possible to use the -i flag to install the packaged, but I did that separately using dpkg.
