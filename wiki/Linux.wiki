#summary Linux related stuff

= Introduction =

This is some linux related stuff I have made a place for.  I intend to break this up at some point but I don't have enough content.

== GUI Notification ==

install libnotify-bin and you get a program called 'notify-send'.  

=== Perl modules ===

  * Gtk2::Notify
  * Desktop::Notify

== Installing oracle libraries on Debian ==

To install the oracle client on debian, you must download some .rpms from the [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/linuxsoft.html Oracle website].  The job I did was on oracle server 8i, so I found out the compatible version I needed was 10.2.0.4.

=== Download ===

  * Basic lite RPM
  * Sqlplus RPM
  * Devel

=== Install ===

Once they are downloaded, install and use `alien` from the debian repository and run

 `alien *.rpm`

By default this will create .deb packages for each rpm.  It's also possible to use the -i flag to install the packaged, but I did that separately using `dpkg`.

The next step is to add the oracle libraries to the search path.  On debian I created a file called `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle.conf` and added the path `/usr/lib/oracle` and more importantly `/usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0.4/client/lib`.  Once that was done, I just ran `ldconfig` to re-initialise the libraries.

=== Notes ===

There were other things I needed to edit to get this working with catalyst and DBIx::Class, namely the schema loader.

`/usr/share/perl5/DBIx/Class/Schema/Loader/DBI/Oracle.pm`

{{{
            SELECT constraint_name, ucc.column_name
            FROM user_constraints JOIN user_cons_columns ucc USING (constraint_name)
            WHERE ucc.table_name=? AND constraint_type='U'
            ORDER BY ucc.position
}}}

Replace with 

{{{
            SELECT user_constraints.constraint_name, user_cons_columns.column_name
            FROM user_constraints, user_cons_columns
            WHERE user_constraints.constraint_name = user_cons_columns.constraint_name
            AND user_cons_columns.table_name=? AND constraint_type='U'
            ORDER BY user_cons_columns.position
}}}

DONE
