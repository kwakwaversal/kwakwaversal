= Introduction =

Inter-tel related chatter that I will use as reference both now, and in the future.

= SMDR =

Station Message Detailed Recording is used to provide a detailed record of outgoing and incoming calls.

On the CS5200, I use the following settings to get the best out of the SMDR.

  * Output port - NONE
  * Local backup port - NONE
  * SMDR Output Active - Yes
  * Output to System Manager - No

= Suspend =

When trying to work out live billing based on information coming into the pbx, I noticed that it's possible to trace the journey of a call using the same monitor as the suspend bot.

Monitor start command:

{{{
  _MS,1,,4,A:0,C:FFFC,F:0
}}}

== Tests ==

I need to test different types of calls to make sure each one of them can be tracked and handled accordingly.

  * Unanswered calls (short, long, diverted)
  * Normal call (ring, established, disconnected)
  * Normal call with successful transfer
  * Normal call with transfer, but no answer
  * Normal call with blind transfer
  * Normal call with multiple transfer attempts before successful transfer

I also need perform the same tests with calls which are transferred internally.
