#summary Stuff about houses that I've picked up

= Introduction =

Exactly what I put in the summary.  This is a collection of snippets of information that might come in handy when looking for, or building onto a new house.


= House types =

Period houses
  * When taking wall paper off period houses, the plaster will most likely come off.  Added expenses.

= Sections =

Extensions
  * When building extensions, always go for pitched roofs, as flat ones will always give you trouble.

Misc
  * If you knock through walls to join two rooms, think about families, and how they would prefer to have two separate spaces.  One for the kids, and one for themselves.

= Misc =

  * Always take into account the direction of the sun in the afternoon.  South-west facing gardens get more sun because in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun is below the zenith during its observed travel from east to west and hence if you are facing south, the sun is shining directly on you during the day. If you are facing North, the sun is shining on your back and in the case of a garden, the shadow of the house blocks the sun most of the time.
